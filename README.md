Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Game details:

How bad this is obviously depends on your system and what settings you are running, but even the worst lurches dissipate quickly, leaving you to continue fighting for your life. After two games of narrow tunnels and the occasional gasping gas masked dash across the poisoned surface, the new environments look like a literal breath of fresh air. So here i was, once more taking that first climb into the outside world. The scene felt jarring, as did an earlier lap dance from a dead eyed stripper that had me peering through my fingers in mortification. The game was released in 2010 and at that time looked very good advanced technology, clear textures, good work with lighting and at the same time a relatively good optimization. Each game can be played in either mode, so i played 2033 redux in spartan mode and last light redux in survival mode just to see what happened. Exploring its broken rendition of russia is a delight, no longer confined.
